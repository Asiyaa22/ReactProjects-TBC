🎯 Objective:
To build a functional student registration form using Unit 4 concepts – controlled components, form validation, and list rendering using useState. This project gives practical experience with handling forms, validating user input, and rendering dynamic data in React.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 4):
▫ Controlled Components
▫ useState Hook
▫ Handling Form Submission
▫ Form Validation (required fields, email format, phone number)
▫ List Rendering
▫ Conditional Rendering (error/success messages)

🛠️ Features to Implement:
▫ A form with the following input fields:
  - Full Name (text)
  - Email (text/email)
  - Phone Number (text)
  - Course (text)
  - Gender (radio buttons – Male/Female/Other)
  - Agree to Terms (checkbox)
  
▫ On form submission:
  - Validate all fields: required checks, valid email format, phone number length
  - Display success message if form is valid
  - Show registered student entries in a list format below the form
  - Clear form inputs after submission

📂 Component Structure:
src/
│
├── App.js                          # Main app rendering the form and student list
├── components/
│   └── StudentRegistrationForm/
│       ├── StudentRegistrationForm.jsx   # Handles all form logic and rendering
│       └── StudentRegistrationForm.css   # Styling for form and list layout
└── index.js                       # Entry point


💡 Notes:
▫ Use `useState` for managing form inputs and registered student list
▫ Apply simple CSS to make the layout clean and readable
▫ Keep the form centered and the entries well-styled for visibility

Expected Output:
🔹 A clean and responsive student registration form
🔹 A styled list of students appearing below the form after submission
🔹 All fields must validate before accepting entries
🔹 Clear and friendly UX for both teachers and students
