🎬 React Assignment – Unit 1
Project Title: Favorite Movie Banner

🧠 Objective
Build a simple React application that displays a banner for your favorite movie using only Unit 1 concepts:

▫ JSX basics
▫ React environment setup
▫ Embedding expressions
▫ Single Page App behavior (no page reloads)

📦 Requirements
Your app must include:

✅ Movie Title (use a variable)
✅ Year of Release (use a variable)
✅ A tagline (1 line)
✅ A paragraph on why you love this movie
✅ An embedded JavaScript expression (e.g. “It’s been X years since release”)

🛠️ Instructions
1. Create a New React App
Run the following commands:
//
npx create-react-app movie-banner-assignment
cd movie-banner-assignment
npm start
//

2. Clean Up the Boilerplate
In src/, delete unnecessary files:

App.test.js, logo.svg, reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js

3. Edit App.js
Replace the contents of App.js with your banner code. You should use:

▫ JSX
▫ const variables
▫ Embedded expressions like {2025 - year}

4. Style It 
You may add basic styling in App.css. 
Keep the layout readable and centered.

💡 Tip:
Pick a movie you really like — your passion will reflect in how you write the description! And make sure your app compiles without any errors.
