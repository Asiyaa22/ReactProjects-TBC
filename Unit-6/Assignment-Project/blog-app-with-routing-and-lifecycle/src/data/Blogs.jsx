    content: `React lifecycle methods are essential hooks that allow you to control what happens 
    when a component mounts, updates, or unmounts. The componentDidMount method is particularly 
    useful for performing side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations after 
    a component has been rendered to the screen. Understanding these lifecycle methods helps in 
    optimizing performance and managing component behavior effectively. Other important lifecycle 
    methods include componentDidUpdate for handling updates and componentWillUnmount for cleanup operations.`,

    Clean code principles include meaningful variable names, proper code organization, and following 
    the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. It's important to write code that is easy to understand, 
    maintain, and modify. This includes proper documentation, consistent formatting, and following 
    established coding standards. Clean code leads to better collaboration, easier debugging, and more

    content: `React Hooks are a powerful way to reuse state logic in functional components. 
    Introduced in React 16.8, hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext provide a more intuitive 
    way to handle state and side effects. They eliminate the need for class components and make it easier 
    to share logic between components. Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable 
    functions, leading to more maintainable and cleaner code. Understanding hooks is essential for 
    modern React development.`,

    It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. 
    Context is particularly useful for sharing data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React 
    components, such as user authentication, theme preferences, or language settings. When combined with 
    hooks like useContext, it offers a clean and efficient way to manage application state.`,
