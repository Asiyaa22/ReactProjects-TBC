🎯 Objective:
To build a simple yet dynamic blog application using class components and React Router, demonstrating the use of lifecycle methods and client-side routing. This project helps students understand component mounting, simulated data fetching, and dynamic routing in a class-based architecture.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 6):
▫ Component Lifecycle in Class Components
   - componentDidMount (for mock data fetch)
   - componentDidUpdate 
   - componentWillUnmount 

▫ Routing in React
   - React Router Basics (Route, Link, useParams, useNavigate)
   - Dynamic Routing for individual blog pages

▫ Mock API Simulation using static blog data
▫ Clean UI structure and code organization

🛠️ Features to Implement:
▫ Home page with a list of blog post cards (fetched from mock data)
▫ Each blog card contains title, author, and a "Read More" link
▫ Clicking "Read More" navigates to `/user/:id` route to show full blog details
▫ Use class-based component for individual blog details page with `componentDidMount`
▫ Add minimal clean styling to make it visually appealing

📘 Expected Output:
- Home Page shows a grid of blog cards
- Each card has a working "Read More" link
- On clicking, user is routed to individual blog detail page
- Content is rendered using `componentDidMount`
- Pages styled with basic but attractive UI
