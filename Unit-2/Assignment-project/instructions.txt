📘 Project Name: Notes App

Project Hosted link : https://notes-app-mf7s.onrender.com/

🎯 Objective:
To create a basic Notes App using only Unit 2 topics – components, props, reusability, and state management with useState. This project will help you understand how data is managed and passed between components in React.

🧠 Concepts Covered (Unit 2):
▫ Functional vs Class Components (Only functional used)
▫ Creating and Using Components
▫ Props in Components
▫ Reusability and Composition
▫ useState Hook
▫ Updating State
▫ State vs Props

🛠️ Features to Implement:
▫ A dummy navbar at the top with just a heading text: "Nav".
▫ A collection of note cards displayed in a grid layout.
▫ Each note card should display text passed through props.
▫ An “Add Note” button (bottom-right corner) that adds a new note when clicked.
▫ Notes should be managed using useState.
